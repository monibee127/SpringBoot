Payment Management System API
A robust RESTful API for managing customers, their bills, and associated payments, built with Spring Boot.

This backend was developed as a learning project to master core concepts of Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and building real-world, transactional web services.

‚ú® Key Features
Customer Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for customers.

Bill Management: Create new bills linked to customers with automatic status calculation (PAID, PARTIALLY_PAID, NOT PAID).

Payment Tracking: Record payments against specific bills, which automatically updates the bill's balance and status.

Combined Operations: A single, transactional endpoint to create a new customer and their first bill simultaneously, including the initial payment record.

Secure by Design: Utilizes DTOs to create a secure API contract, preventing infinite recursion loops and decoupling the API from the internal database structure.

Relational Data Model: A well-structured schema with clear relationships between Customers, Bills, and Payments.
